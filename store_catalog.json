The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around).\n\nShould either brother fall from a great height or get injured, the game restarts at a recent checkpoint. All of the in-game dialogue is spoken in a fictional language, thus the story is conveyed through actions, gestures and expressions.",

Player takes on the role of Sigrid, a headstrong girl who gains the ability to run on water through the help of a mysterious shadow. Wavetale offers a tight-knit story combined with a charming art style and delightful soundtrack and invites players to explore its world through its fast-flowing gameplay, where traditional platforming elements meet a unique surfing experience on a dynamic ocean. The intuitive controls make Wavetale accessible and family friendly, while at the same time encouraging mastery as the player will need to understand the full range of movement. Guide Sigrid through the archipelago as the calamity that once sunk the city once again looms on the horizon.",

Unlike previous Lego games in which players had to advance through the story in a linear order, players can now choose to start the game from any of the main Skywalker Saga episodes and complete them in any order they wish. Each episode has their own hub filled with planets featured prominently in each respective film that can be visited and explored. Each episode will have five story missions each, a total of 45 levels.\n\nCombat has also been revamped, such as lightsaber fights now involving a variety of combos with light attacks, heavy attacks, and Force moves, and blaster characters having an over-the-shoulder camera angle featured in many third-person shooter games.\n\nRandom encounters will also happen in the game's hub. For example, an Imperial Star Destroyer will suddenly jump out of hyperspace and send a fleet of TIE Fighters after the player. Players can choose to engage in dogfights with them or continue onward to progress the story. The game will have more than 200 playable characters, though TT Games has said that number will change.",

      "igdb_summary": "Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.",
      "igdb_storyline": "Bedrock Edition (also known as the Bedrock Version or just Bedrock) refers to the multi-platform family of editions of Minecraft developed by Mojang Studios, Xbox Game Studios, 4J Studios, and SkyBox Labs. Prior to this term, as the engine originated with Pocket Edition, this entire product family was referred to as \"Pocket Edition\", \"MCPE\", or \"Pocket/Windows 10 Edition\".\n\nAll Bedrock editions of Minecraft use the title Minecraft with no subtitle. The current version of Bedrock editions is 1.16.0. Before the Better Together Update, they had different subtitles on each platform, including Pocket Edition (for all mobile platforms), Windows 10 Edition, Gear VR Edition, and Fire TV Edition. Xbox One Edition, Nintendo Switch Edition, and PlayStation 4 Edition were originally part of Legacy Console Edition before the Better Together Update, and their features had to be ported to Bedrock Edition. Apple TV Edition was discontinued shortly afterwards, thus it was no longer updated and removed from the App Store on Apple TV devices.\n\nAlthough all Bedrock versions are nearly identical, the price varies depending on the platform. Approximate prices are listed in USD; Mobile versions cost US$6.99 (€7.99, £6.99, AU$10.99). PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Fire TV cost US$19.99 (€19.99, £16.74, AU$29.95). The Windows 10 and Nintendo Switch versions are the most expensive, costing US$29.99 (€19.99, £16.74, AU$39.95). The Windows 10 version is sold in a Starter Collection or Master Collection, the latter costing US$49.99 (€49.99, £39.99, AU$69.95) and including more DLC and Minecoins.[33] DLC purchased from the Marketplace on one platform is usable on all other platforms, but the game itself is sold separately on each platform. Despite all being UWP apps, Minecraft is sold as 3 separate apps at different prices on Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, and Xbox One. (This means that Xbox Live achievements are not shared between these platforms and buying the game on one of these platforms does not get the game on the others. There are sets of achievements for each platform). The Xbox One version is also playable to Xbox Game Pass subscribers. As with Java Edition, updates are free of charge.",

Fight or flee through canyons, swamps and – of course – mines! Any adventurer brave or foolish enough (or a bit-of-both!) to explore this blocky and beautiful world will need to come prepared. So quickly, gear up!\"",
      "igdb_storyline": "Minecraft Dungeons is set in the same fictional world as Minecraft, known as the \"Overworld\", consisting of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called \"blocks\"—representing various materials, and inhabited by both peaceful and hostile mobs. Unlike 'Minecraft', the game features a linear, story-driven campaign, and cutscenes.\n\nThe opening cutscene tells the story of an illager named Archie, who was driven away by his people. While searching for a new home, he was forced to leave every village he found due to Villagers not allowing him to live with them. One day, Archie stumbled upon a powerful artifact known as the Orb of Dominance, which granted him magic powers but also corrupted him. Now known as the \"Arch-Illager\", he sought vengeance on all those who wronged him and subjugated numerous villages with his newly acquired army, composed of creatures such as redstone golems and other Illagers. Players assume the role of heroes who embark on a quest to defeat the Arch-Illager while liberating oppressed villages, fighting monsters, and completing various quests. Ultimately, the players face the Arch-Illager in his castle and, once defeated, the orb takes its true form as the Heart of Ender boss. This is the final boss of the game. After destroying the Heart of Ender aka the Orb of Dominance, Archie is freed from its influence. Rather than punish Archie for his actions, the players show him kindness and forgiveness and quickly befriend him. As the players and Archie depart, the Orb is shown to be rebuilding itself. It is then found by an Enderman who picks up the orb and goes into the End. The last scene in the cutscene shows an Endersent climbing out of the portal. In the game, after defeating Archie, players unlock new difficulties that make the game more challenging but provide better rewards.",
